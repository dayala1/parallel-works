    - title: "openSkies"
      desc: "An R package for processing public air traffic data. The package provides an interface to the OpenSky Network resources, standardized data structures to represent the different entities involved in air traffic data, and functionalities to analyze and visualize such data. Furthermore, the portability of the implemented data structures makes openSkies easily reusable by other packages, therefore laying the foundation of aviation data engineering in R."

    - title: "asteRisk"
      desc: "A comprehensive suite for astrodynamics analysis in R. The package includes implementations of some of the most frequently applied orbital propagators, including the SGP4 and SDP4 models, as well as a high-precision numerical orbital propagator. Additionally, utilities for reading file formats commonly used to distribute satellite positions (ephemerides), as well as to perform conversion between different frames of reference and time systems are provided."
